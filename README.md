<h3 align="leftr">About me...</h3>

- 👩🏻‍🎓 I am currently a **second year MS HCDE student.**

- 🌱 I have a background in **studio art and environmental science.**

- 🧠 I’m excited to learn more about **how to use digital fabrication tools to create both artistic and functional work while further exploring my interests in ethical design, the environment, and the interaction between humans x technology.**

- 🛠 I would love to share more with the class about **letting go of artistic expectations for the sake of getting your hands dirty and learning.**

- ✨ A fun fact about me is that **I am a shameless outfit repeater.**
