            <h3>Assignment Prompt</h3>
    
  <p>Create a parametric model using a grasshopper definition. Using your model, design parts to be laser cut that can be clipped together. Your physical model should contain at least 30 parts.</p>
  
  <h3>My Approach</h3>
    
  <p> For this assignment, I wanted to focus on learning the basics of grasshopper (instead of creating something complex) because I noticed myself struggling to follow along during the in-class demonstration, which signaled to me that I needed to put more effort into learning the ins and outs of the tool. To focus on learning the basics, I used the recording of the in-class demonstration to build a basic parametric model of a circle. I struggled for a while with getting my notches trimmed but ended up playing with the connections between the trim components and the join component and ended up finding the right connections to bake three circle shapes with various notch amounts. I also noticed that the bake command presented me with the option to bake different layers, and I would love to learn more about why that happens and what to do when presented with that information?  After working through any problems I was having with Grasshopper, I ended up with one circle with ten notches, one with five, and one with two. I wanted to make my design at least somewhat unique by continuing with the cut shape motif I used in my previous laser cut assignment. I added those patterns in Illustrator after I exported my Rhino file as an AI file. Once I had all of my designs adjusted, I followed the same process that I did during the last assignment to laser-cut my cardboard press-fit kit.</p>
