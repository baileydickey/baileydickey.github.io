 <h3>Assembling My 3D Printer</h3>
    
  <p>Approximate time to complete: 
4.5 hours of assembly, 45 minutes calibrating and making minor tweaks to the machine.
</p>
  
  <h3>The Assembly Process</h3> 
  
<p> 
I assembled the printer long before this assignment came about, so I did not document every step of the process. I carefully followed the printed instructions that came with the kit and ensured that I kept my parts and tools organized throughout the process. I found that assembly was generally a straightforward process and, luckily, did not face any major roadblocks. 

After I completed the physical assembly process, I followed the assignment instructions and the troubleshooting deck to make minor adjustments to the printer. I found that my extruder did not need to be tightened as it was not wiggling when I checked on it. Then I check for loose screws and checked my printer’s belts to ensure that they were taught. I found that my belt was slightly loose, so I went ahead and increased the tension slightly to ensure that my circular objects would not become skewed while printing. I also struggled with threading my filament through the extruder until I realized that cutting the end of the filament at an angle would help it glide through the opening more easily.

Finally, I went through the build plate leveling process by downloading the Filament Friday bed leveling protocol. I spent roughly 8 minutes using a piece of paper to manually adjust each build plate level screw. I then ran the build plate level test print and ran my finger along each extruded line to ensure proper adhesion and that my plate was level. I somehow managed to level my printer properly on my first try, so I was able to move on to my first test printed fairly quickly.

<p>A 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" settings.
Print time: 23 min</p>

<p>A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings. 
Print time: 26 min</p>

<p>A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings.
Print time: 50 min</p>

<p>A 2 cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer and your favorite print setting from the previous cubes.
Print time: 26 min</p>

<p>Print time and size of cubes: the print time for these cubes ranged from 23 minutes to nearly an hour (for the higher-quality cube prints). After measuring my first test cube, I found that one side was roughly .5 mm longer than I had set out to make it, so I went in to adjust my print settings to get a closer match.</p>

<h3>Test Print Process Nested Parts</h3>
<img src="Concentricprint.jpg" width=400></a>
<p>“Design a series of nested parts that can be 3D printed in their nested state. You should have at least 3 nesting structures. Export the objects as one STL, and 3D print the nested structure.”
Print time: 1 hour and 50 min</p>
