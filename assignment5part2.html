<h3>Finishing my  Lamp</h3>
    
 <p> Using my sketches from earlier, I finalized my lamp design in Rhino. I ended up going with the crystal ball shaped shade and flat base. </p>

<p>I printed several tests of the spherical shade and found that I was struggling with adhesion and gaps in my print despite using a brim and re-leveling my bed several times. I figured the new clear filament I was using was part of the problem, so I bumped the temperature of the nozzle and the bed up and this helped with the clarity of the printed filament and solved some of the bed adhesion challenge. However I was still struggling and found that gaps were occurring at the top of my sphere. So, I made the layer height smaller, increased the top layers, and made the top print in a concentric pattern. This solved the rest of my adhesion and gapping issues, and I ended up with a clean spherical shade. </p>

</p>I also struggled to create the bulb holder bit of my lamp, and now realize that I needed to be using boolean commands to ensure that my mesh was closed and valid for Cura. Now that I have realized this I can go back into Rhino and reprint my base to work with the classic light bulb as well. However, I am glad that I struggled with this nit because I ended up creating a more simple base that fits with my wireless light bulb/string lights and these light sources bring a nice gentle glow to the final design and use less power.</p>

<h3>Assignment 6 Part 1: Creating my Mold</h3>
    
 <p> I began this process by testing fits for my alignment pegs. It took three quick prints to find the right allowance.</p>

 <p>In the past I have regretted not going with a simple design for mold making. So, I finally tried to learn from my past mistakes and went with a simple donut design that I downloaded from the thingiverse files in my source section. I followed some of the instructions in <ahref="https://msd-makerspaces.gitbook.io/next-lab/3d-printing/key-techniques/split-models-rhino-3d-and-physical-joining"><p>this post</p></a> <p>to help guide the construction of my mold for my mold.</p>

 <p>The mold is currently printing and I have my Oomoo which I will use to cast my mold.</p>
